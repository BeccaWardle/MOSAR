ToDo:
-----

- Write up proper README
- Fix melt, sort grow
- Properly format morsecraft.py
- Set up repository as a virtual environment, auto-install dependancies
- Set CleanMORSE as the main repo (remove BadMORSE and others)
- Add true support for orientation of non-cuboid modules (path finding doesn't change the orientation)
- Add controllers for module orientation to modControl and in morsecraft
