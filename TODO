ToDo:
-----

- Add method documentation to github
- Fix melt, sort grow
- Properly format morsecraft.py
- Set up repository as a virtual environment, auto-install dependancies
- Add true support for orientation of non-cuboid modules (path finding doesn't change the orientation)
- Add controllers for module orientation to modControl and in morsecraft
- Add support for different sized modules
- Silence MORSE output so that main.py can be run and still be used to debug
