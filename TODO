ToDo:
-----

- Add method documentation to github
- Fix melt, sort grow
- Add unit-testing described by: [morse testing](https://www.openrobots.org/morse/doc/stable/dev/testing.html)
- Properly format morsecraft.py
- Set up repository as a virtual environment, auto-install dependancies
- Add true support for orientation of non-cuboid modules (path finding doesn't change the orientation)
- Add controllers for module orientation to modControl and in morsecraft
- Add support for different sized modules
- Silence MORSE output so that main.py can be run and still be used to debug
- Rewrite so code is distributed (better simulate real world use)
- Implement code into module robots (requires rewriting to distributed first)
